This is an example post demonstrating how I can upload diagrams directly from my phone to this blog. 

This post serves as a test case for that workflow - from concept to sketch to published post.

## Image Placeholder

*Caption: Uploaded from my phone.*

## How Did It Go?

1. The placeholder that GitHub Copliot suggested was a.png. I'll see what my phone creates. **It created a .jpg file.**
2. Despite searching around in the Android app, I couldn't find a way to upload a file directly. I could create a new text file, but not upload an image.

I'm going to raise a ticket to get Copilot to remove the Android GitHub app from the docs. I'll try Termux next.
