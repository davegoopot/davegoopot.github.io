This is an example post demonstrating how I can upload diagrams directly from my phone to this blog. 

This post serves as a test case for that workflow - from concept to sketch to published post.

## The Workflow

1. **Capture**: Draw or sketch on my phone
2. **Upload**: Add the image to this blog post
3. **Publish**: Share the content with context

## Image Placeholder

![Diagram from phone - example](../images/2025-07-26-from-phone-diagram.png)
*Caption: Uploaded from my phone.*

The placeholder that GitHub Copliot suggested was a.png. I'll see what my phone creates.
