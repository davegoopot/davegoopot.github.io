This is an example post demonstrating how I can upload diagrams directly from my phone to this blog. 

I've been working on streamlining my workflow for capturing ideas and sketches on the go. Often, I'll draw diagrams or take notes on my phone, and I want to be able to easily share them here on my blog.

This post serves as a test case for that workflow - from concept to sketch to published post.

## The Workflow

1. **Capture**: Draw or sketch on my phone
2. **Upload**: Add the image to this blog post
3. **Publish**: Share the content with context

## Image Placeholder

<!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder with the actual image upload -->
![Diagram from phone - placeholder for image upload](../images/2025-07-26-placeholder-phone-diagram.png)
*Caption: This will be replaced with an actual diagram uploaded from my phone*

## Why This Matters

Having a frictionless way to go from idea to published content removes barriers to sharing. Sometimes the best insights come when you're away from your computer, and being able to capture and share those moments is valuable.

This is just the beginning of optimizing my mobile-to-blog workflow!
