I've been thinking a lot about my posting frequency lately. I have so many ideas and thoughts I want to share, but I often get caught up in endless editing and second-guessing myself before hitting publish.

The truth is, I want to post more often and not worry about checking and re-checking everything to death before publishing. Perfection is the enemy of done, and I've let that perfectionist mindset hold me back from sharing more of my thoughts and experiences.

From now on, I'm committing to:

- **Publishing more frequently** - Even if the post isn't perfect, if it has value, it should go out
- **Embracing "good enough"** - Not every post needs to be a masterpiece  
- **Learning through iteration** - I'll improve by doing, not by endlessly polishing drafts
- **Focusing on value over perfection** - If it helps someone or shares something useful, that's what matters

This mindset shift applies beyond just blogging. In coding, in projects, in life - sometimes we need to ship the thing, get feedback, and iterate rather than trying to make everything perfect from the start.

So here's to more posts, more experiments, and more sharing of works-in-progress. Done is better than perfect.
