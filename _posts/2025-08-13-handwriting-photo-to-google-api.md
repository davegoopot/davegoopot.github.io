I want to explore the process of uploading handwriting photos directly from my phone to Google's handwriting recognition API. This could streamline digitising handwritten notes and diagrams.

## The Plan

The basic workflow I'm planning to test:

1. **Capture handwriting** with phone camera
2. **Optimise the image** for API processing
3. **Authenticate with Google API** from mobile
4. **Upload to handwriting recognition service**
5. **Process the results**

## Setup Requirements

### Google Cloud Setup
- [ ] Create Google Cloud project
- [ ] Enable Vision API or appropriate handwriting recognition service
- [ ] Generate API credentials
- [ ] Set up authentication (service account key or OAuth)

### Mobile Environment
- [ ] Choose approach: direct HTTP calls vs SDK
- [ ] Set up development environment (Termux, web app, or native app)
- [ ] Install required packages for API calls

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Capture the Handwriting

**Photo capture guidelines:**
- Good lighting conditions
- High contrast between text and background  
- Stable shot to avoid blur
- Appropriate distance for text clarity

**Image preparation:**
```bash
# Placeholder for image optimisation commands
# - Resize if needed
# - Adjust contrast/brightness
# - Convert to appropriate format
```

### 2. API Authentication

**Service account approach:**
```bash
# Placeholder for authentication setup
# - Download service account key
# - Set environment variables
# - Test authentication
```

**OAuth approach (if using web interface):**
```javascript
// Placeholder for OAuth flow
// - Redirect to Google auth
// - Handle callback
// - Store access token
```

### 3. API Call Structure

**Basic API request format:**
```bash
# Placeholder for curl command or SDK call
# POST request to Google Vision API
# Include image data and configuration
# Specify handwriting detection features
```

**Expected request format:**
```json
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "image": {
        "content": "base64-encoded-image-data"
      },
      "features": [
        {
          "type": "DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Processing Results

**Response handling:**
```javascript
// Placeholder for response processing
// - Extract text content
// - Handle confidence scores
// - Deal with multiple text blocks
// - Error handling
```

## Mobile Implementation Options

### Option A: Termux + Command Line
- Use `curl` for API calls
- Image processing with ImageMagick
- JSON parsing with `jq`

### Option B: Progressive Web App
- Camera API for image capture
- JavaScript for API calls
- Works across devices

### Option C: Native Android App
- Camera2 API for image capture
- Retrofit for API calls
- Full native performance

## Expected Challenges

**Technical challenges to test:**
- [ ] Image quality vs file size trade-offs
- [ ] API rate limits and costs
- [ ] Authentication complexity on mobile
- [ ] Handling poor handwriting recognition

**Workflow challenges:**
- [ ] Speed of the complete process
- [ ] Offline capability requirements
- [ ] Integration with note-taking apps

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Google Cloud project** and enable APIs
2. **Test basic API calls** from desktop first
3. **Implement mobile capture workflow**
4. **Optimise image processing pipeline**
5. **Measure accuracy and performance**
