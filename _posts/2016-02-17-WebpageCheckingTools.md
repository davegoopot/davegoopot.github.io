title: Tools for Checking Webpage Quality
---

My graphics design skills are not going to win any prizes. To help me not make a complete fool of myself at website design I use these three tools to check for obvious failures:

* The audit function build into Chrome's developer tools
* The W3C unified validator at: https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/
* Google's page speed tester (it actually checks layout and mobile errors too) at: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/
