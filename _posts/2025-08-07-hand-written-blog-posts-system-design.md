A system for creating blog posts that starts with paper and pen and ends up published on the web.

## The Challenge

Creating a smooth workflow from handwritten notes and sketches to published blog posts that preserves the benefits of analog thinking whilst leveraging digital publishing.

## System Overview

*[System design diagram to be uploaded here]*

## Process Flow

### Stage 1: Analog Capture
- Paper and pen brainstorming
- Initial concept sketches
- Rough outline development

### Stage 2: Digital Transition
- Content structuring
- Image processing workflow
- Markdown conversion

### Stage 3: Publishing Pipeline
- Jekyll site integration
- Quality assurance
- Deployment to GitHub Pages

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Start Analog?
- Reduces cognitive load of digital tools during initial creative phase
- Allows for non-linear thinking and sketching
- No distractions from formatting or technical concerns

### Integration Points
- Handwriting recognition considerations
- Image upload and optimisation workflow
- Version control integration

## Implementation Notes

*To be documented based on real-world usage and iteration*

## Next Steps

- Document detailed workflow steps
- Create templates for common post types
- Measure efficiency gains over direct digital authoring
