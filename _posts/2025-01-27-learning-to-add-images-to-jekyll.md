I have to admit something: I don't know how to add images to Jekyll pages on GitHub Pages properly. 

This feels like it should be straightforward, but every time I try to include images in my blog posts, I run into issues. Where should I store the images? What's the correct path to reference them? How do I make sure they work both locally and when deployed to GitHub Pages?

I've got an `images` directory in my repository, and I can see there's already one image file in there (`2017-04-08-chrome-ext.png`), but I'm not confident about the best practices for:

- Organizing image files
- Referencing them in markdown posts  
- Ensuring they load correctly across different environments
- Optimizing them for web delivery

Rather than fumble around and potentially break things, I'm going to work with GitHub Copilot agents to figure this out properly. It seems like the perfect opportunity to leverage AI assistance for learning something that should be simple but has been tripping me up.

I'll document what I learn in a follow-up post once I've got it sorted out. Stay tuned!
