I'm going to make my own Cookiecutter template with VS Code workspace configuration and GitHub Copilot instructions that match my coding preferences.


For detailed information on creating repository custom instructions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions#creating-a-repository-custom-instructions-file).

## Progress

The first attempt with Copilot resulted in it developing a vast and complex template for a Python project. After calming it down with pull request comments I've managed to get the simple template I wanted.

I need to change the Copilot instructions to match my coding approach, keep it simple, before this is useful.
