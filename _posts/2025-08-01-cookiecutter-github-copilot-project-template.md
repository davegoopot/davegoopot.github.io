I'm going to make my own Cookiecutter template with VS Code workspace configuration and GitHub Copilot instructions that match my coding preferences.


For detailed information on creating repository custom instructions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions#creating-a-repository-custom-instructions-file).
