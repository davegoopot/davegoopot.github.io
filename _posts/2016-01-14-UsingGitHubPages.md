title: Using GitHub Pages
---

I'm starting out with my site hosted on (GitHub Pages)[https://pages.github.com/]. 
At the outset this is just me typing HTML directly into the GitHub editor. 
I intend to follow the (instructions)[https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/] to set up the built in 
Jekyll markdown blog generator in the future.
